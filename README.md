# Playing Blackjack using Reinforcement Learning

This file contains the code for the final RL project. We are trying to teach an agent how to play blackjack using Q-Learning and SARSA and different action selection strategies.

To run the program, run main.py and follow instructions. At the end of the simulations you will see two graphs. One for average rewards over episodes and one for wins+losses over episodes.
